Some people may be interested in what are the future plans with SteamCAD. The answer is
there are none. SteamCAD is finished software (the only one in the whole computer world?),
there are no plans to extend it. It does everything it was supposed to do, if there are
bugs in the software, they are now the features of the software.

Well, not quite so. Of course, if the software need some adjustment in the future to
work on new operating systems, it will be updated.

I have some plans to use the SteamCAD engine as a base for a 3D CAD, but it would be
a different software with different name. And there is definitively no timeframe when this
might occurr.

\subsection{What to do if snap does not seem to work?}
It may happen that the cursor snaps to one line but strictly ignores another line
intersecting the first one. You checked all the lines involved and all have snap enabled.
This may happen if for some reason a line is doubled. Try to delete the line, where the
snap works to see, if there is not another line at the same place.
